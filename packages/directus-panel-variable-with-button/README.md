# Directus Global Variable Panel with Button

Extends the global variable panel with a button to save the variable.

## Usage

This panel allows you to create a variable which is globally accessible across other panels. You can use this to do
things like create a string or number to prefix other insights panel titles or pass it as a value into a filter to query
results.

In contrast to the built-in global variable panel, this panel allows you to save the variable manually by clicking the
save button.
